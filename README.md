# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

This project is a College Registration Form built with React.js, featuring full CRUD functionality. Users can register students using a form powered by React Hook Form with validation. Submitted data is displayed in a dynamic Material-UI (MUI) table, where students are listed, and users can edit or delete entries directly from the table. Context API manages global state across the app. React Toastify is used for real-time notifications (e.g., "Student added" or "Entry deleted"), and SweetAlert2 provides confirmation dialogs. This project offers a clean, responsive UI with efficient state management.
